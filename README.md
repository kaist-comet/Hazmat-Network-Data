This repository contains two road network data, which may be useful for research in hazardous materials transportation. See the `data` directory of this repository for data. The listed research articles used the data. 


## Albany Network

The complete version of the Albany network first appeared in the following paper:
```
@incollection{toumazis2013value,
  title={Value-at-risk and conditional value-at-risk minimization for hazardous materials routing},
  author={Toumazis, Iakovos and Kwon, Changhyun and Batta, Rajan},
  booktitle = {Handbook of OR/MS Models in Hazardous Materials Transportation},
  editor = {Batta, Rajan and Kwon, Changhyun},
  pages={127--154},
  year={2013},
  publisher = {Springer New York},
}
```

This network, or its variants, was used in the following papers:
